            <h3>My First Post</h3>
            <p class="blog1">I have said for a number of weeks now that I would make a personal website or make a company. With all of my procrastination and 
                other poor excuses for avoiding this task, I have done almost nothing to make these goals happen. While this might seem like a negative 
                way to start off on a journey, I feel it is better this way as it is some kind of a start. What exactly I will do with this website still
                escapes me, but it seems that if I start putting something "out there" regularly enough, this will sort itself out. Having recently read 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834 ">"Atomic Habits"</a> by <a href="https://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a>, 
                I am feeling somewhat inspired and motivated- or more accurately, I have changed my habits and state of mind for the better (I hope!). 
                This book was a very interesting read and made me question and eradicate some, but not all, of my bad habits. This article in itself is a testament to this improvement. 
                To me, the last statement is almost comical as I'm sitting in my sitting room at home trying to write a blog post before I have a domain or a website bought. 
                Self-confidence is magical.<br>
                Just over three months into lockdown and I have finally got myself together enough to pretend to be writing for a blog or a company website or whatever this is going to be. 
                The eternal battle between the part of me that wants to make something of myself and the part that is content with mediocrity rages on as it has done for as long as I can remember.
                It seems that for each new sentence I write, I dislike the previous one even more. I will continue writing, though, because it is the 
                only way to improve. At this stage I am just "brain puking". Every thought that comes into my head is getting thrown out onto the screen
                and there is nothing I can do, or want to do, to stop it. This is not something I would show my friends, family, or anyone, actually,
                but if nothing else comes of this brain puke, at least I'll have started. <br>
                One thing that I have done with my free time during this lockdown that hasn't been a total waste of time is that I've started learning to code.
                I started with HTML and CSS and have continued on to JavaScript. JavaScript has proven to be infinitely more difficult, probably because
                I had literally no experience with it prior to starting to learn it this week. It is quite a hard thing to start, I have found. Much like
                maths, if you make a mistake the whole thing goes wrong and it can often be very difficult to see where you've gone wrong. For example., today
                I was following a step-by-step tutorial on YouTube and everything was going brilliantly. I had had very few issues with it for the first 90% 
                of the work (although it sounds supremely simple, following videos on YouTube can be quite tricky) and then everything crumbled. What was once 
                working perfectly suddenly stopped working totally and started screaming "error" at me. It was a heart-crushing mistake that simply
                would not reveal itself to me. I know exactly what that sounds like; noob thinks he knows it all and can't spot a simple error, which is 
                partially true, but after about an hour of tracing back my steps and the steps in the video, I couldn't find it. This was amazingly infuriating, 
                to put it mildly, and I had to stop before I had a meltdown. It was this mistake that led me to this once more- starting my website. 
                JavaScript seemed, and still does seem, like an impossible task, but come tomorrow morning I'll be willing to try it again. <br>
                I hope in years to come I look back on this article and be proud of how far I've come, but for now it's just an embarrassing start.
